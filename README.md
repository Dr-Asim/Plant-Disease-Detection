# Fruit trees and Vegetable Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification

The repository contain a source code for the Training and Testing process. Two type of datasets, the PlantVillage and local field images has been used for the training and testing of models. The dataset of PlantVillage was collected from the open source platform known as Kaggle. While, the local field images were collected from the farms of Tarnab. The sample images are presented in the sub-folder named as Tarnab-Images. A research paper has also been published and sent for the peer-review process in the journal of PLOS. The paper explained all the obtained results for different data splits. The link for paper is given below.
